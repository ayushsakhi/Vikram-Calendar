                    The Hindu calendar, also called Panchanga, is one of various lunisolar calendars
                     that are traditionally used in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, with further regional
                      variations for social and Hindu religious purposes. They adopt a similar underlying concept for
                        timekeeping based on sidereal year for solar cycle and adjustment of lunar cycles in every
                     three years, but differ in their relative emphasis to moon cycle or the sun cycle and the names 
                     of months and when they consider the New Year to start. Of the various regional calendars,
                      the most studied and known Hindu calendars are the Shalivahana Shaka (associated with the King 
                      Shalivahana and basis for the Indian national calendar) found in the Deccan region of Southern 
                      India and the Vikram Samvat (Bikrami) found in Nepal and the North and Central regions of 
                      India - both of which emphasize the lunar cycle. Their new year starts in spring. In regions 
                      such as Tamil Nadu and Kerala, the solar cycle is emphasized and this is called the Tamil
                       calendar (though Tamil Calendar uses month names like in Hindu Calendar) and Malayalam 
                       calendar and these have origins in the second half of the 1st millennium CE. A Hindu 
                       calendar is sometimes referred to as Panchangam, which is also known as Panjika 
                       in Eastern India.
                       <br><br>

                    The ancient Hindu calendar conceptual design is also found in the Babylonian calendar, the Chinese
                     calendar, and the Hebrew calendar, but different from the Gregorian calendar. Unlike the 
                     Gregorian calendar which adds additional days to the month to adjust for the mismatch between 
                     twelve lunar cycles (354 lunar days) and approximately 365 solar days, the Hindu calendar 
                     maintains the integrity of the lunar month, but inserts an extra full month, once every 32–33
                      months, to ensure that the festivals and crop-related rituals fall in the appropriate season.

                    The Hindu calendars have been in use in the Indian subcontinent since Vedic times, and remain in 
                    use by the Hindus all over the world, particularly to set Hindu festival dates. Early Buddhist 
                    communities of India adopted the ancient Vedic calendar, later Vikrami calendar and then local 
                    Buddhist calendars. Buddhist festivals continue to be scheduled according to a lunar system.
                     The Buddhist calendar and the traditional lunisolar calendars of Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Sri 
                     Lanka and Thailand are also based on an older version of the Hindu calendar. Similarly, the 
                     ancient Jain traditions in their calendar have followed the same lunisolar system as the Hindu 
                     calendar for festivals, texts and inscriptions. However, the Buddhist and Jain timekeeping systems
                    have attempted to use the Buddha and the Mahavira's lifetimes as their reference points.

                    The Hindu calendar is also important to the practice of Hindu astrology and zodiac system. It is 
                    also employed for observing the auspicious days of deities and occasions of fasting, such as 
                    Ekadashi

                    The Vedic culture developed a sophisticated time keeping methodology and calendars for Vedic 
                    rituals, and timekeeping as well as the nature of solar and Moon movements are mentioned in
                     Vedic texts. For example, Kaushitaki Brahmana chapter 19.3 mentions the shift in the relative
                      location of the Sun towards north for 6 months, and south for 6 months.
                      <br><br>

                    Time keeping was important to Vedic rituals, and Jyotisha was the Vedic era field of tracking and
                     predicting the movements of astronomical bodies in order to keep time, in order to fix the day 
                     and time of these rituals. This study is one of the six ancient Vedangas, or ancillary
                      science connected with the Vedas.

                    Yukio Ohashi states that this Vedanga field developed from actual astronomical studies in ancient 
                    Vedic Period. The texts of Vedic Jyotisha sciences were translated into the Chinese 
                    language in the 2nd and 3rd centuries CE, and the Rigvedic passages on astronomy are found in the 
                    works of Zhu Jiangyan and Zhi Qian. According to Subhash Kak, the beginning of the Hindu calendar
                     was much earlier. He cites Greek historians describing Maurya kings referring to a calendar which
                      originated in 6676 BCE known as Saptarsi calendar.

                    The Vikram calendar is named after king Vikramaditya and starts in 57 BCE.
